## 📁 Project Files Overview

This project includes two main files that form the core of the desktop automation agent:

### `main.py`

This script connects to the **Playwright MCP server** built by Microsoft and acts as a client that communicates with the server to perform browser automation tasks.(**It connects to MCP server but Not Working Properly. i will back to it later**)

### `playwright_direct_agent.py`

This script integrates Playwright tools directly into a **reAct-style agent** pattern built using **LangGraph**.
Although still a work in progress, it is functional and can accept natural language commands such as:

> "Open xyz.com website, then go to abc.net, stay there for 10 seconds, and close the tab."

The script will interpret and execute these browser actions step-by-step.

### `Omniparser_Api.py`
- Calls the Omniparser demo API hosted on Hugging Face Spaces.

### `Omniparser_API_overcolab.ipynb`
- A notebook that **demanded countless hours of troubleshooting and setup** due to compatibility issues among various Microsoft repositories.
- Resolves package inconsistencies to enable execution on Colab.
- Intended for deployment via Gradio or Ngrok as a temporary API service.
