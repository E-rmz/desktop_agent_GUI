2025-06-08 19:27:06,492 - INFO - AGENT REPLY: I have opened YouTube and waited for 10 seconds. However, I can't perform the search for "eminem" as I lack the functionality to interact with the webpage elements. I can only navigate to a URL, wait, and take a screenshot. Would you like me to take a screenshot of the current page?
2025-06-08 19:27:06,492 - INFO - TOOL STEP 1: Okay, I can do that. Here's the plan:

1.  **Launch the browser:** I will start a new browser instance.
2.  **Navigate to YouTube:** I will open the YouTube website.
3.  **Wait for 10 seconds:** I will wait for the page to load.
4.  **Take a screenshot:** I will save a screenshot of the YouTube homepage.
5.  **Search for "eminem":** I will simulate searching for "eminem" on YouTube. (Note: I can't actually type into the search bar, but I can navigate to the YouTube search results page for "eminem".)
6.  **Wait for 10 seconds:** I will wait for the search results to load.
7.  **Take a screenshot:** I will save a screenshot of the search results page.

Here's the execution:
